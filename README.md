# Description

Swetting up a new .NET project can be tedious, even with the native scaffold CLI. This projet was created as a basic CRUD  starter for new ASP.NET core projects. Simply clone and start modifying generic components and add your own custom logic. It contains commonly used .NET package dependencies, boilerplate code, and a project directory structure which facilitates repository pattern and dependency injection. It also utilizes DTO with Automapper as well .NET core deployment files for Azure Cloud.
